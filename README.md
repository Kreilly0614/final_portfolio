Four of my best projects in my opinion during Creative Coding, Fall 2019.


Firstly, the reworked Glitch Art. My personal favorite out of all that we did during this year, and took eight brand new pictures
and glitched them as well, often times coming out where the colors were inverted or moved. I mostly used Audacity this time as well.
It allowed me to create some of my best work in the class so far, I feel. This time around I was also much more consistent
in creating quality glitch art, and I personally think they all came out a lot better. Mostly this all came from just having experience
from the last attempt, and knowing how to create better quality images as a result.

Second is the reworked Clock. I took a bit of a different spin on it this time, the idea to make the clock seem like it's floating or
in it's own space. I think turning everything but the colors of the time pieces added a bit more "popping out" for the actual content,
with no other colors getting in the way of it. I also worked to make the hour piece the largest, and getting smaller and smaller until
milliseconds, which just seemed to make more sense to me due to the speed they move. I believe it came out a lot better with these
adjustments, or rather what probably would've been the optimal thing to submit the first time.

Third is the 50,000 word novel. I wasn't even aware I had originally messed up and not given any way to view the actual novel. I've added
a link to the pdf of it, along with a brief exerpt of its nonsense. I touched up some of the phrases used, but otherwise had to keep it
the same due to Google collab not accepting most of the changes. Overall, I think it's very good and even pretty funny to read at first.
Reworking some better sentence structure into it this time helped tremendously to make it appear more like a novel and not just a long
wall of text for around 200 pages.

Fourth and final project is the Screensaver. Reworked. I feel the original screensaver was one of my best looking projects in this class
by far, and I used your example from the comment and took away the background from within the draw loop. After messing with the random
variables and color scheme enough, it actually came out fantastic. I love how it's a complete mess yet all blends together really well.
I changed the color to a blue specifically to match the theme of "rain" as well, with the last color not having as much meaning in my
opinion. Going back to this, as well as all the other projects, showed me that I actually learned a lot and was able to fix simple
mistakes that I had made earlier on. It surprised me how much better I was able to make these, and somewhere down the line I will be
able to make these said improvements better as well.
